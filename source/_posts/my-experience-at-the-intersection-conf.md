This October I attended the [Intersection Conference EU](https://www.intersection-conference.eu/) in Milan, Italy. The Conf covers everything from product design to front-end development. The first day we had full-day workshops. I took part in the class The Web In Motion taught by [Val](https://milano2019.intersection-conference.eu/val_head), whose way of teaching was very helpful and attractive. There were only 6 people in this workshop, but I did made new engineer friends in Italy. The next day we had the Conference presentations in two venues, which were fairly rich in content. The most impressive speeches for me were [NATIVE WEB APPS](https://milano2019.intersection-conference.eu/web-apps) and [AN SVG'S TALE](https://milano2019.intersection-conference.eu/svg-tale).

Here are the notes I took.

While having the opportunity to go to Europe, I also traveled from Switzerland to Italy, spent days taking the train from a landscape of lakes and mountains through to the fashionable and historical cities. What impressed me most about Italy was the lovely people there, the artistic buildings, last but not least, the heavenly gelato!
